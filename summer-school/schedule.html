          <h3>Combinatorial surface models for cluster algebras and cluster categories</h3>
          <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Karin Baur</p>
          <p>Surface combinatorics have been instrumental in describing algebraic structures such as cluster algebras and cluster categories, gentle algebras, etc. 
              In this course, I will show how triangulations give rise to cluster algebras and to cluster categories. 
              We will also study the combinatorial approach to Grassmannian cluster algebras and cluster categories. </p>
          <p>Time permitted, we will also discuss how tilings of surfaces give gentle algebras and module categories. </p>

          <h3>Symmetric tensor categories</h3>
          <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Pavel Etingof (TBC)</p>
          <h4>Lecture 1: Algebra and representation theory without vector spaces.</h4>
          <p>A modern view of representation theory is that it is a study 
            not just of individual representations (say, finite dimensional 
            representations of an affine group or, more generally, supergroup scheme
            \(G\) over an algebraically closed field \(k\)) but also of the category \(Rep(G)\) 
            formed by them. The properties of \(Rep(G)\) can be summarized by saying 
            that it is a symmetric tensor category (shortly, STC) which uniquely 
            determines \(G\). A STC is a natural home for studying any kind of linear
            algebraic structures (commutative algebras, Lie algebras, Hopf algebras,
            modules over them, etc.); for instance, doing so in \(Rep(G)\) amounts to
            studying such structures with a \(G\)-symmetry. It is therefore natural to
            ask: does the study of STC reduce to group representation theory, or is
            it more general? In other words, do there exist STC other than \(Rep(G)\)?
            If so, this would be interesting, since algebra in such STC would be a
            new kind of algebra, one "without vector spaces". Luckily, the answer
            turns out to be ``yes". I will discuss examples in characteristic zero
            and \(p>0\), and also Deligne's theorem, which puts restrictions on the kind 
            of examples one can have.</p>
            <h4>Lecture 2: Representation theory in non-integral rank.</h4>
            <p>Examples of symmetric tensor categories over complex numbers which are
not representation categories of supergroups were given by Deligne-Milne
in 1981. These very interesting categories are interpolations of
representation categories of classical groups \(GL(n)\), \(O(n)\), \(Sp(n)\) to
arbitrary complex values of n. Deligne later generalized them to
symmetric groups and also to characteristic $p$, where, somewhat
unexpectedly, one needs to interpolate n to $p$-adic integer values rather
than elements of the ground field. I will review some of the recent
results on these categories and discuss algebra and representation
theory in them.</p>
            <h4>Lecture 3. Symmetric tensor categories of moderate growth and modular
representation theory.</h4>
<p>Deligne categories discussed in Lecture 2 violate an obvious necessary
condition for a symmetric tensor category (STC) to have any realization
by finite dimensional vector spaces (and in particular to be of the form
$Rep(G)$): for each object $X$ the length of the n-th tensor power of $X$
grows at most exponentially with $n$. We call this property "moderate
growth". So it is natural to ask if there exist STC of moderate growth
other than $Rep(G)$. In characteristic zero, the negative answer is given
by the remarkable  theorem of Deligne (2002), discussed in Lecture 1.
Namely Deligne's theorem says that a STC of moderate growth can always
be realized in supervector spaces. However, in characteristic $p$ the
situation is much more interesting. Namely, Deligne's theorem is known
to fail in any characteristic $p>0$. The simplest exotic symmetric tensor
category of moderate growth (i.e., not of the form $Rep(G)$) for $p>3$ is
the semisimplification of the category of representations of $Z/p$, called
the Verlinde category. For example, for $p=5$, this category has an object
$X$ such that $X^2=X+1$, so $X$ cannot be realized by a vector space (as its
dimension would have to equal the golden ratio). I will discuss some
aspects of algebra in these categories, in particular failure of the PBW
theorem for Lie algebras (and how to fix it) and a generalization of
Deligne's theorem in characteristic p obtained by Coulembier, Ostrik and
myself, with applications to modular representation theory. I will also
discuss a family of non-semisimple exotic categories in characteristic p
constructed in my joint work with Dave Benson and Victor Ostrik, and
their relation to the representation theory of groups $(Z/p)^n$ over a
field of characteristic $p$.</p>
<h4>Lecture 4. Oligomorphic groups and tensor categories.
</h4>
<p>I will try to give a brief introduction to the work of Harman and Snowden about
symmetric tensor categories attached to oligomorphic groups, in particular
discuss the Delannoy category.

          <h3>Homology of racks and quandles</h3>
          <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Markus Szymik</p>
          <p>This series of lectures will delve into the homological aspects of racks and
quandles, starting with the foundational concepts. We will define the canonical
chain complexes and explore their low-dimensional homology and cohomology. By
working through some examples by hand, we will uncover the strengths and
limitations of the direct approach. We will then transition into a more
conceptual and flexible framework inspired by Quillen's general theory. We
explain a proof that this leads to the same result and show that it allows us
to compute the entire integral homology of all permutation racks, for example.
Throughout the exposition, we will compare the homology theories of racks and
quandles with those of groups and group actions, illuminating their
similarities and differences. This field is lush with unanswered questions and
untrodden challenges. As we progress, we will highlight as many of them as
possible to engage the audience with the theory and enable them to contribute
to ongoing research.
