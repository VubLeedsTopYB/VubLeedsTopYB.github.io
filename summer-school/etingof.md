Title: Symmetric tensor categories.

Lecture 1: Algebra and representation theory without vector spaces.

Abstract: A modern view of representation theory is that it is a study
not just of individual representations (say, finite dimensional
representations of an affine group or, more generally, supergroup scheme
G over an algebraically closed field k) but also of the category Rep(G)
formed by them. The properties of Rep(G) can be summarized by saying
that it is a symmetric tensor category (shortly, STC) which uniquely
determines G. A STC is a natural home for studying any kind of linear
algebraic structures (commutative algebras, Lie algebras, Hopf algebras,
modules over them, etc.); for instance, doing so in Rep(G) amounts to
studying such structures with a G-symmetry. It is therefore natural to
ask: does the study of STC reduce to group representation theory, or is
it more general? In other words, do there exist STC other than Rep(G)?
If so, this would be interesting, since algebra in such STC would be a
new kind of algebra, one "without vector spaces". Luckily, the answer
turns out to be ``yes". I will discuss examples in characteristic zero
and p>0, and also Deligne's theorem, which puts restrictions on the kind
of examples one can have.

Lecture 2: Representation theory in non-integral rank.

Examples of symmetric tensor categories over complex numbers which are
not representation categories of supergroups were given by Deligne-Milne
in 1981. These very interesting categories are interpolations of
representation categories of classical groups GL(n), O(n), Sp(n) to
arbitrary complex values of n. Deligne later generalized them to
symmetric groups and also to characteristic p, where, somewhat
unexpectedly, one needs to interpolate n to p-adic integer values rather
than elements of the ground field. I will review some of the recent
results on these categories and discuss algebra and representation
theory in them.

Lecture 3. Symmetric tensor categories of moderate growth and modular
representation theory.

Deligne categories discussed in Lecture 2 violate an obvious necessary
condition for a symmetric tensor category (STC) to have any realization
by finite dimensional vector spaces (and in particular to be of the form
Rep(G)): for each object X the length of the n-th tensor power of X
grows at most exponentially with n. We call this property ``moderate
growth". So it is natural to ask if there exist STC of moderate growth
other than Rep(G). In characteristic zero, the negative answer is given
by the remarkable  theorem of Deligne (2002), discussed in Lecture 1.
Namely Deligne's theorem says that a STC of moderate growth can always
be realized in supervector spaces. However, in characteristic p the
situation is much more interesting. Namely, Deligne's theorem is known
to fail in any characteristic p>0. The simplest exotic symmetric tensor
category of moderate growth (i.e., not of the form Rep(G)) for p>3 is
the semisimplification of the category of representations of Z/p, called
the Verlinde category. For example, for p=5, this category has an object
X such that X^2=X+1, so X cannot be realized by a vector space (as its
dimension would have to equal the golden ratio). I will discuss some
aspects of algebra in these categories, in particular failure of the PBW
theorem for Lie algebras (and how to fix it) and a generalization of
Deligne's theorem in characteristic p obtained by Coulembier, Ostrik and
myself, with applications to modular representation theory. I will also
discuss a family of non-semisimple exotic categories in characteristic p
constructed in my joint work with Dave Benson and Victor Ostrik, and
their relation to the representation theory of groups (Z/p)^n over a
field of characteristic p.

Lecture 4. Oligomorphic groups and tensor categories.

I will try to give a brief introduction to the work of Harman and Snowden about
symmetric tensor categories attached to oligomorphic groups, in particular
discuss the Delannoy category.
