Homology of racks and quandles

This series of lectures will delve into the homological aspects of racks and
quandles, starting with the foundational concepts. We will define the canonical
chain complexes and explore their low-dimensional homology and cohomology. By
working through some examples by hand, we will uncover the strengths and
limitations of the direct approach. We will then transition into a more
conceptual and flexible framework inspired by Quillen's general theory. We
explain a proof that this leads to the same result and show that it allows us
to compute the entire integral homology of all permutation racks, for example.
Throughout the exposition, we will compare the homology theories of racks and
quandles with those of groups and group actions, illuminating their
similarities and differences. This field is lush with unanswered questions and
untrodden challenges. As we progress, we will highlight as many of them as
possible to engage the audience with the theory and enable them to contribute
to ongoing research.
